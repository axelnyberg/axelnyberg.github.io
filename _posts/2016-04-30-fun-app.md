This project is very fresh and will be updated. 

This app is being developed for fun and to learn when I have time. Thought, I may have use for it in the future because I see it as a basis one can develop in several directions.
The navigation bar is called [BLKFlexibleHeightBar](https://github.com/bryankeller/BLKFlexibleHeightBar/)

**Language:** Swift

**Features:**<br>
*The navigation bar can hide and show even if the app is using scrollview with x amount of tableviews inside.<br>
*The navigation bar will show every time user changes view horizontally.<br>
*Custom cells, not used yet though.
