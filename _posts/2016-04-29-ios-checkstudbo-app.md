![Geometric pattern with fading gradient](/img/checkstudbo.gif)

Very basic iOS app which looks for changes in every 5 sec of a webpage.

This app would never be accepted by Apple, still I had use for it to get an apartment. It checks studbo.se every 5 seconds to notice if a new apartment has been published. 

Features:<br>
*downloads html of studbo.se every 5 sec<br>
*search for where in html studbo writes number of apartments<br>
*alerts if number of apartments changes<br>
*button which links to studbo.se
