**The first App I ever made**

Developed an app in Xcode during a course at Jönköping University. The application is similar to Instagram - create an account, upload images/videos and share them with your friends. This project just fulfilled the requirements of the course, so the application isn't responsive and the code need refactoring. The interface is a mess becouse the functional part was only the important in the course. The course was at least finished with highest grade.

*Load data from REST-API<br>

*location services<br>
*mapkit<br>
*in app playable videos<br>
